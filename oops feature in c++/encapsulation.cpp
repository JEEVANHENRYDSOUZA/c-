    //object creation ----1.static
    //2.dynamic

    //copy constructor
    //normal constructor
    //parametrized constructor
    //access modifier 
    //public
    //private
    //protected
    //public------ within class,outside class
    //private---within class , no for outside class
    //protected----within class , outside using inheritance
    //empty class--does not give any error
    //empty class is size of 1------reason is it is the minimum space the compiler has
    //four pillars of oops:
    //1.inheritance
    //2.polymorphism
    //3.encapsulation
    //4.



    //1.encapsulation:binding data member and functions together is called encapsulation
    //when a class has both private data members and methods then we have achieved high encapsulation
    //advantages of this:clean code,reusability,increases security
